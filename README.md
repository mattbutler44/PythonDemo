# PythonDemo

Imports, manipulates, and encrypts text from an outside source; manipulates book cover.

This requires Python to be installed on the user's computer. 

This program was made in a programming class.

This program inputs the contents of a text file, strips away punctuation, and encrypts the text using a simple Caeasar shift.
The shift is randomized so the results will vary from user to user.
The text file is a portion of a book review on my favorite book.
The encrypted text is then saved in a new text file on the user's computer.

The book cover is displayed, then has the colors inverted.
The inverted image is placed next to the original for easy comparison.

The program also searches for occurences of the letters "x" and "q" and stores them in a dictionary.
(I plan on changing this to counting all letters. This should be quick and easy.)
This dictionary displays each "rare letter" along with their count in the original (unencrypted) file.

The program also shows some system information about the user's computer and operating system.

Finally, an L-system is implemented in an admittedly silly way.
It was a requirement that I had a hard time naturally fitting into the program.
Anyway, a simple sentence is modified using the L-System with the results displayed in the console.

This program was an attempt to use as many features and techniques as possible.
Included are: nested loops, enhanced loops, recursion, object orientation, dictionary and list manipulation, image processing,
  file input and output, simple encryption, and randomization.
